** Installation

Require this script

: (require 'rpn-calc)

and invoke with =M-x rpn-calc=.

** Tutorial

1. You can push objects by pressing =[SPC]= after entering an
   S-expression (try: =120[SPC]=). You can also enter more complex
   S-expressisons like =(1+ (point))=.

2. When you enter an operator name, top elements in the stack are
   popped and applied to the operator (try: =1[SPC]sin=). List of
   built-in operators are listed below. You can add some operators by
   setting variable =rpn-calc-operator-table=.

3. You can also enter a function symbol to call it (try:
   =10[SPC]'number-to-string[SPC]=). If the function accepts =&rest=
   arguments, all elements in the stack are passed (try:
   =10[SPC]20[SPC]30[SPC]'list[SPC]=). This behavior can be changed by
   setting =rpn-calc-apply-rest-args=.

** Other Features

- auto-committing

  If there seems no ambiguity, rpn-calc automatically commits the
  input after entering :

  - a number followed by non-digit character ::

    =1'1+[SPC]= is equivalent to =1[SPC]'1+[SPC]=.

  - outer-most closing paren ::

    =(1+ (point))[SPC]= is equivalent to =(1+ (point))=.

  - complete operator name ::

    =1sin= is equivalent to =1sin[SPC]=.

- display binary representation of numbers

  When you push some numbers, their binary representation is
  displayed.
